# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

I have created this project as part of my Full stack development course at Code Institue. in this project I demonstrate the use of HTML, CSS, GIT, GITHUB, and GITPOD.

This project show some examples of of how pages are linked together under the nav section using anchor tags, how images and content are displayed, and how pseudo elements change the state of the nav bar when hovered over .

This also demonstrates the linking of the style sheet style.css in the head section to style all of the html elements found in pages index.html, stream-two.html, and stream-three.html.

The content is has been sourced from http://www.wikipedia.org as well as some of the the logos that represent the web technologies.

This  project has been version controled using git and published using github
